# Fundamentals of Programming Languages Projects

Welcome to the Fundamentals of Programming Languages Portfolio! This repository showcases various projects completed during the course, including individual assignments and group projects.

## About the Course

The fundamentals of programming provide the essential foundation for developing software applications. Key concepts include:

- **Syntax:** The grammar of a programming language.
- **Semantics:** The meaning behind the code.
- **Data Types:** Understanding types like integers, floats, and strings for representing different kinds of information.
- **Variables:** Containers for storing data, allowing for dynamic manipulation.
- **Control Flow Structures:** Conditional statements and loops that dictate the program's execution path based on specific conditions.
- **Functions:** Modularize code, promoting reusability and organization.
- **Input and Output Operations:** Facilitate communication between the program and the user or external systems.

By mastering these core concepts, programmers can design, implement, and maintain software solutions effectively.

## Individual Projects

### Project 1: Area of Shapes

This project features a basic area calculator. It includes functions to calculate the areas of triangles, circles, and squares. The program presents a menu for the user to select a shape and prompts for the necessary dimensions (base and height for triangles, radius for circles, and length for squares). It then calculates and displays the area using the appropriate formula. The process repeats until the user chooses to exit.

### Project 2: Grade System

This project implements a simple grade system that converts numerical scores into letter grades. It defines grade boundaries and their corresponding letter grades. Users input scores and receive immediate grading feedback. The system ensures valid input and continues execution until the user opts to exit.

### Project 3: Login Interface

This project involves creating a login interface, managing the visual elements and functionalities associated with user authentication. The frontend typically uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend uses languages like Python, Java, or Node.js for server-side processing.
